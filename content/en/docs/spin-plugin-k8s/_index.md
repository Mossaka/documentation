The [Spin k8s plugin](https://github.com/spinkube/spin-plugin-k8s) is designed to enhance Kubernetes by enabling the execution of Wasm modules directly within a Kubernetes cluster. This plugin works by integrating with containerd shims, allowing Kubernetes to manage and run Wasm workloads in a way similar to traditional container workloads.
