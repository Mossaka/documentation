The runtime-class-manager is a Kubernetes operator designed to automate and manage the lifecycle of containerd shims. It provides a robust and production-ready solution for installing, updating, and removing shims, as well as managing node labels and runtime classes in a Kubernetes environment. 

By automating these processes, the runtime-class-manager enhances reliability, reduces human error, and simplifies the deployment and management of containerd shims in Kubernetes clusters.
