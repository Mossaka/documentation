The [Runtime Class Manager, also known as the Containerd Shim Lifecycle Operator](https://github.com/spinkube/runtime-class-manager), is designed to automate and manage the lifecycle of containerd shims in a Kubernetes environment. This includes tasks like installation, update, removal, and configuration of shims, reducing manual errors and improving reliability in managing WebAssembly (Wasm) workloads and other containerd extensions.
