Everything you need to know about SpinKube.

## First steps

To get started with SpinKube, follow our [Quickstart guide]({{< ref "quickstart" >}}).

## How the documentation is organized

SpinKube has a lot of documentation. A high-level overview of how it's organized will help you know
where to look for certain things.

- [Installation guides]({{< relref "install" >}}) cover how to install SpinKube on various
  platforms.
- [Topic guides]({{< relref "topics" >}}) discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly high level and provide useful background
  information and explanation.
- [Reference guides]({{< relref "reference" >}}) contain technical reference for APIs and other aspects of SpinKube's machinery.
  They describe how it works and how to use it but assume that you have a basic understanding of key
  concepts.
- [Contributing guides]({{< relref "contrib" >}}) show how to contribute to the SpinKube project.
- [Miscellaneous guides]({{< relref "misc" >}}) cover topics that don't fit neatly into either of the above categories.
