The [Spin Operator](https://github.com/spinkube/spin-operator/) enables deploying Spin applications to Kubernetes. The foundation of this project is built using the [kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder) framework. Spin Operator defines Spin App Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). Spin Operator watches SpinApp Custom Resources e.g. Spin app image, replicas, schedulers and other user-defined values and realizes the desired state in the Kubernetes cluster. Spin Operator introduces a host of functionality such as resource-based scaling event-driven scaling and much more.
