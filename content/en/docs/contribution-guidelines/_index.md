## Updating a single documentation page

If you've just spotted something you'd like to change while using the docs, Docsy has a shortcut for you:

1. Click **Edit this page** in the top right-hand corner of the page.
2. If you don't already have an up-to-date fork of the project repo, you are prompted to get one - click **Fork this repository and propose changes** or **Update your Fork** to get an up to date version of the project to edit. 

## Previewing your changes locally

If you want to run your own local Hugo server to preview your changes as you work:

1. Install [Go]()
2. Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/).
3. Run `hugo server` in this site's root (`developer`) directory. By default the documentation will be available to view at http://localhost:1313/.
4. Continue with the usual GitHub workflow to edit files, commit them, push the
  changes up to your fork, and create a pull request.

## Creating a documentation related issue

If you've found a problem in the docs, but you're not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an issue in the [documentation repository](https://github.com/spinkube/documentation/issues). You can also create an issue about a specific page by clicking the **Create Issue** button in the top right-hand corner of the page.
